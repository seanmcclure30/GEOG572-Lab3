        <p class="lightGray">The goal of my submission for the Lab 3 assignment was to compose a web map in the style of
        17th century Baroque paintings using Mapbox Studio. I took inspiration from the Flemish artist
        Clara Peeters who primerarly created beautiful still life oil paintings depicting dining tables with
        different assortments of decadent meals common for aristocratic living of the time period.
        Clara Peeters' works were notable for her mastery of the Baroque style and for being one of the
        earliest artist to include hidden self-portraits usually reflecting in the brass or glass subjects
        in her paintings. Her use of rich dark tones accented by sharp light colors is an aesthetic I aimed
        to replicate in this web map. I hope you will enjoy exploring the included map.</p>
